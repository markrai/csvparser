note to self: Forget about CSVParse. Simply parse the CSV files and build the record objects, line by line
using quotes to denote the records. Store as array, and extract values 

database construct:

datetime | destination  | number | minutes | direction |  type   
             Incoming                         incoming    Picture       
             Rockville, MD                    outgoing    Text
                                                          wifi
                                                          call             

Messages:
date, time, destination, number, direction, text type

Calls:
date, time, destination, number, minutes, call type


1. dirCheck() check directory for csv files.

2. parseCSV() goes over csv file
	looks for line #3
	 if "messaging charges" is found, begin on line 8
	  and pick up date, time, destination, number, direction, text type

		2b. fixMessageTime() shifts all time stamps to 3 hours forward to match EST.
	  
3. convertToDateTime() takes date and time and creates a singular datetime ISO8601 value. 
	  
4. if "local airtime" is found, begin on line 9
   and pick up date, time, destination, number, minutes, call type 
	 
5. writeToDB() 
     write 5 fields depending on type of file parsed (message or call)

6. repeat.
